# RemarkableLamyEraser
Standalone tool that turns the button on the Lamy Pen into an eraser on the reMarkable.

Also confirmed to work with these other styli:
 * Kindle Scribe Pen
 * Samsung S6 S Pen
 * Wacom One Pen CP91300B2Z
 
*As an alternative, consider using [this](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-stylus). (If you're already using ddvk-hacks, I'd defintely reccomend this route. This tool is for people who are looking for a less invasive option, and prefer the unaltered look of the reMarkable interface.)*

The tool will definitely break when the reMarkable updates. When that happens, just reinstall!

*  toolbar : Presses the toolbar panel button  
*  writing : Presses the writing utensil button  
*  undo : Presses the undo button

*  eraser          : Changes to eraser tool. on deactivation, changes back to writing utensil  
                    note that on the RM2, this mode uses special features available from the marker plus.
